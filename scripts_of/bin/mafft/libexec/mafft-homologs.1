.RS 0
The accuracy of an alignment of a few distantly related sequences is considerably improved when being aligned together with their close homologs. The reason for the improvement is probably the same as that for PSI\-BLAST. That is, the positions of highly conserved residues, those with many gaps and other additional information is brought by close homologs. According to Katoh et al. (2005), the improvement by adding close homologs is 10% or so, which is comparable to the improvement by incorporating structural information of a pair of sequences. Mafft\-homologs in a mafft server works like this:
